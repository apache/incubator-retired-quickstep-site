  <h1 id="apache-incubating-quickstep-database">Apache (incubating) Quickstep Database</h1>

<p>Quickstep is a next-generation data processing platform that starts with an underlying relational kernel core. The key design philosophy is to ensure that these kernels - and compositions of these kernels - can exploit the full potential of the underlying hardware. We call this design principle running at bare-metal speed.</p>

<p>Bare-metal means to fully exploit the latest hardware trends including large main memories, fast on-die CPU caches, highly parallel multi-core CPUs, and NVRAM storage technologies.</p>

<p>For the hardware available in the future, we aim to co-design hardware and software primitives that will allow the data processing kernels to work on increasing amounts of data economically - both from the raw performance perspective, and from the perspective of the energy consumed by the data processing kernels and the applications running on the platform.</p>

<h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>
<p>Quickstep is easy to get set up. It currently runs on a single node and supports a SQL front-end, and doesn’t require tuning parameters. To get started, follow the <a href="https://github.com/apache/incubator-quickstep/blob/master/README.md">quickstart guide</a>.</p>

<h2 id="community">Community</h2>
<p>Quickstep is an Apache (incubating) project. If you want to learn more about the community, follow the dev conversation at <a href="mailto:dev@quickstep.incubator.apache.org">dev@quickstep.incubator.apache.org</a></p>

<h2 id="roadmap">Roadmap</h2>

<p>The current roadmap is to produce a platform that can run relational database applications using SQL as the interface. The longer-term roadmap is to cover a broader class of analytics.</p>

<h3>Disclaimer</h3>
<small>Apache Quickstep is an effort undergoing incubation at The Apache Software Foundation (ASF), sponsored by the Apache Incubator. Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects until a further review indicates that the infrastructure, communications, and decision making process have stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects. While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability of the code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.</small>
